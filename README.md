# 1 2 connect! Annyeonghaseyo Enhypen-ibnida
-------------------
## Enhypen
###  A South Korean boy band formed by Belift Lab, a joint venture between CJ ENM and Hybe Corporation, through the 2020 survival competition show I-Land. The group is composed of seven members. The group's name, Enhypen, was introduced during the live broadcast of the final episode of I-Land. Etymologically, Enhypen derives its name from the hyphen symbol (-), representing "Connection, Discovery, & Growth". Similar to how a hyphen connects different words to create new meanings, Enhypen aims "to come together to connect, discover and grow together to form a new act".
